## Nifty Click - the future of minting NFTs

## ðŸ“¸click.ðŸ“±edit. ðŸ–¼ mint.

We're building the simplest userflow for clicking images and minting them as NFTs without ever leaving the app. No more transfering images to computer, setting up Metaplex Sugar CLI, and creating metadata files. We handle everything for you, in a clean, and simple user interface.

:construction: mobile app is a work-in-progress.
note: we tried building with Kotlin, but that didn't work (check it out [here](https://github.com/niftyclick/app)). now, we're working on a React Native solution [here](https://github.com/niftyclick/rn).
